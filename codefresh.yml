#    timeout: 150
#    # Candidate is optional, if not specified will redeploy the same image that specified in the deployment file
#    # When candidate exist it should have both: image and registry
#    candidate:
#      # The image that will replace the original deployment image
#      # The image that been build using Build step
##      image: ${{build_step}}
#      image: ${{build_step}}
#      # The registry that the user's Kubernetes cluster can pull the image from
#      # Codefresh will generate (if not found) secret and add it to the deployment so the Kubernetes master can pull it
#      registry: dockerhub
